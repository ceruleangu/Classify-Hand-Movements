# Classify-Hand-Movements
Our goal is to classify biological data gathered from sEMG signals into six classes of hand movements. The approaches we used include Feedforward Neural Networks, Adaptive Boosting, Random Forests, Linear Discriminant Classifier, etc. The methods we used to improve our performance include empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and intrinsic mode function (IMF).
